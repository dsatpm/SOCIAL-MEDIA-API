# Social Media Backend API

This project is using MongoDB as the database for the backend of a social media app. It does not have any forward facing content, as it is just an application highlighting how the routes and server work for adding friends, adding comments, deleting posts, and checking users. 


## Installation

Since this is a backend application, Node.js and MongoDB are required to view this project. Documentation on how to install Node can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) and MongoDB documentation can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).



## Usage

This application is designed for people to get a visual idea of how a server operates and how we navigate the functionality of adding friends, posting comments, etc.
